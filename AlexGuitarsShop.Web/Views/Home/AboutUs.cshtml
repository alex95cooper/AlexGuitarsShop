                <h2>AlexGuitarsShop: the first in Ukraine specialized store of guitars and equipment</h2>

                <p>Our shop is more than 10 years old. During this time, thousands of guitarists crossed the threshold of our store, we sold and repaired thousands of guitars and answered tens of thousands of questions from guitarists when choosing the instrument.</p>

                <p>The AlexGuitarsShop picked out thousands of dollars worth of premium models to make one guitar for life. We had our first $200 guitar and fell in love with music. It was all happening in plain sight.</p>

                <p>We know guitarists better because we know them. So it doesnâ€™t matter: you choose the first guitar for yourself or choose the tenth in the collection. You buy a gift for a child or colleagues, or you plan to realize a long-term dream. We will listen to you carefully, understand what you are looking for and select the best instrument for you.</p>
